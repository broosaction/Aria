A few possible reasons:<ul><li>If the &quot;User-declared canonical&quot; and &quot;Google-selected canonical&quot; values are different, this means that this URL is one of a set of similar pages, and Google has chosen to index another version of the same page.

See <em><a href="#url_unknown">URL is unknown to Google</a></em>.</dd><dt><strong>Sitemaps</strong></dt><dd>Any known sitemaps that point to this URL. <strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> This includes only sitemaps submitted using the <a href="/webmasters/answer/7451001">Sitemaps report</a> or listed in the robots.txt for this site. Sitemaps discovered through other means won&#39;t be listed. For larger or new sites, it is <a href="/webmasters/answer/156184">a good practice to provide a sitemap to help Google know which pages to crawl</a>. <a href="#known_issues" rel="noopener">See known issues.</a></dd><dt><strong>Referring page</strong></dt><dd>A page that Google <em>possibly</em> used to discover this URL. The referring page might directly link to this URL, or it might be a grandparent or great-grandparent of a page that links to this URL. If this value is absent it doesn&#39;t mean that no referring page exists, just that this information might not be available to the&nbsp;URL Inspection tool at this time. If you see &quot;URL might be known from other sources that are currently not reported&quot;, it means that Google found this URL through some means other than a sitemap or referring page, but the referring information&nbsp;currently isn&#39;t available to this&nbsp;tool.</dd><dt><strong>Last crawl</strong></dt><dd>The last time this page was crawled by Google, in your local time.

If you did not intend to block Google, you should remove the robots.txt block. Note that this is <strong>not</strong> the same as allowing indexing, which is given by the &quot;<em>Indexing allowed?&quot;</em> value.</dd><dt><strong>Page fetch</strong></dt><dd>Whether or not Google could actually get the page from your server. If crawling is not allowed, this field will always show a failure. If crawling is allowed, page fetch might still fail for various reasons. <a href="/webmasters/answer/7440203#status_types">See explanations of fetch failures.</a> Crawl allowed is an indication of whether you want the page to be reachable; page fetch is whether Google could actually reach it, if allowed.</dd><dt><strong>Indexing allowed?</strong></dt><dd>Whether or not your page <a href="/webmasters/answer/93710">explicitly disallowed indexing</a>. If indexing is disallowed, the reason is explained, and the page won&#39;t appear in Google Search results.&nbsp;<strong><em>IMPORTANT</em>&nbsp;</strong>If your page is blocked by robots.txt (see &quot;Crawl allowed&quot;), then &quot;Indexing allowed&quot; will always be &quot;Yes&quot; because Google can&#39;t see and respect the noindex directive. In that case, your page might appear in Search results.</dd><dt><strong>User-declared canonical</strong></dt><dd>Your declared&nbsp;<a href="/webmasters/answer/139066">canonical URL</a>, if the page explicitly declares one. You can declare a canonical URL in several ways: a <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot;&gt;</code> tag, an HTTP header, a sitemap, or&nbsp;<a href="/webmasters/answer/139066#methods">a few other methods</a>. If your page is one of a set of similar or duplicate pages, we recommend explicitly declaring the canonical URL. For AMP pages, this should be the non-AMP version (unless it is a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/discovery#what-if-i-only-have-one-page?">self-canonical AMP</a>).</dd><dt><strong><a id="google-selected-canonical"></a>Google-selected canonical</strong></dt><dd><p>The page that Google selected as the <a href="/webmasters/answer/139066">canonical (authoritative) URL</a>, when it found similar or duplicate pages on your site. If you declared a canonical URL, Google might select the same URL, but sometimes Google might choose another URL that it considers a better canonical example. You can&#39;t guarantee the Google-selected canonical for a URL, but you can <a href="/webmasters/answer/139066#methods">suggest one</a>. If the page has no alternate versions, the Google-selected canonical is the inspected URL. If you find an unexpected page here, consider <a href="/webmasters/answer/139066">explicitly declaring a canonical version</a>. This will only be shown if you have permissions on the property that the canonical belongs to.</p><p>The canonical URL is not always the one shown in Search results: for example, if a page has a desktop canonical and a mobile version, mobile searches will probably show the mobile page URL.</p><p>Note that this value can be a few hours behind the value in our index.</p><p>If the page is not the canonical URL, you can inspect the Google-selected canonical URL by selecting <strong>Inspect</strong>.
